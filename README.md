# DI Orchestrator

DI Orchestrator is designed to manage DI ([Decision Intelligence](https://github.com/opendilab/DI-engine/)) jobs using Kubernetes Custom Resource and Operator.

### Prerequisites

- A well-prepared kubernetes cluster. Follow the [instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/) to create a kubernetes cluster, or create a local kubernetes node referring to [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) or [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

### Install DI Orchestrator

DI Orchestrator consists of two components: `di-operator` and `di-server`. Install them with the following command.

```bash
kubectl create -f ./config/di-manager.yaml
```

`di-operator` and `di-server` will be installed in `di-system` namespace.

```bash
$ kubectl get pod -n di-system
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
di-operator-57cc65d5c9-5vnvn       1/1     Running   0          59s
di-server-7b86ff8df4-jfgmp         1/1     Running   0          59s
```

### Submit DIJob

```bash
# submit DIJob
$ kubectl create -f config/samples/atari-dqn-tasks.yaml

# get pod and you will see coordinator is created by di-operator
# a few seconds later, you will see collectors and learners created by di-server
$ kubectl get pod
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
job-with-tasks-collector-0   1/1     Running   0             2s
job-with-tasks-collector-1   1/1     Running   0             2s
job-with-tasks-evaluator-0   1/1     Running   0             2s
job-with-tasks-learner-0     1/1     Running   0             2s
